# So, the baseline estimate at the end is 63.30952, and the

## Holt-Winters exponential smoothing with trend and without seasonal component.
## 
## Call:
## HoltWinters(x = myts, gamma = FALSE)
## 
## Smoothing parameters:
##  alpha: 0.8455303
##  beta : 0.003777803
##  gamma: FALSE
## 
## Coefficients:
##           [,1]
## a 81.729657393
## b -0.004838906
#
# Notice that the final trend estimate (b) is very close to zero
# (-0.004838906) and the value of beta is also very close to zero.
# This suggests that there isn't really a significant trend.


# Triple exponential smoothing (additive seasonality)

m3a <- HoltWinters(myts)
m3a

# Lots of output (123 seasonal factors) but the key is that
# b and beta are again both zero or very close to it.


# Triple exponential smoothing (multiplicative seasonality)

m3m <- HoltWinters(myts,seasonal="multiplicative")
m3m

# Lots of output (123 seasonal factors) but the key is that
# b and beta are again both zero or very close to it.

# m3m$fitted[4] shows the seasonal factors for each data point.
#
# Put the factors into a matrix

m <- matrix(m3m$fitted[,4],nrow=123)

From here, we can run the same CUSUM analysis as in the previous homework, but on the seasonal factors.
